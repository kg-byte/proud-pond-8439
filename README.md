* AmusementParks have a name and price of admissions attributes
  * ex. name: 'Six Flags', admission_cost: 75 
* Mechanics have a name and years of experience attributes
  * ex. name: ‘Kara Smith’, years_experience: 11
* Rides have a name, thrill rating, and open (boolean) attributes
  * ex. name: ‘The Hurler’, thrill_rating: 7, open: false
* AmusementParks have many Rides
* Rides belong to an AmusementPark
* Mechanics can work on many Rides
* Rides can have many Mechanics working on them

Some of the initial migrations and model set up has been done for you.

Story 1 - Mechanic Index Page

As a user,
When I visit the mechanics index page
I see a header saying “All Mechanics”
And I see a list of all mechanic’s names and their years of experience
And I see the average years of experience across all mechanics

Story 2 - Mechanic Show Page

As a user,
When I visit a mechanic show page
I see their name, years of experience, and the names of rides they’re working on
And I only see rides that are open
And the rides are listed by thrill rating in descending order (most thrills first)
```

Story 3 - Add a Ride to a Mechanic

As a user,
When I go to a mechanics show page
I see a form to add a ride to their workload
When I fill in that field with an id of an existing ride and hit submit
I’m taken back to that mechanic's show page
And I see the name of that newly added ride on this mechanics show page

Ex:
Mechanic: Kara Smith
